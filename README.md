**Blaaark** : Control Flow Edition.

It used to be Monosvkem. 
It was Monodark for a little while.  
Now it's Blaaark.

Functions are out.  
Constants, strings, special and statements are in.

Will *not* support 3rd party syntax files unless the default vim files
are subpar or broken. Those tweaks go into your .vimrc, not into your
colorscheme.  

You know the drill.
